#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited to implement the game, add the hint button, randomizer, and update the metadata and logo:

```
mini-app/app/page.tsx
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
mini-app/components/game.tsx
mini-app/app/(level)/page.tsx   # one file per level (you can create these)
```

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to add a few new files to implement the game and the logo.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```
mini-app/components/game.tsx
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once those files are added, I’ll supply the changes for `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and `mini-app/app/page.tsx`.

I can’t edit any files until you add the relevant files to the chat.  
Please add the files you want changed (e.g. `mini-app/components/game.tsx`, `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`, etc.) so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
